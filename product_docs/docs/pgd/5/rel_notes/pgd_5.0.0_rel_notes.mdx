EDB Postgres Distributed version 5.0.0 is a patch release of EDB Postgres Distributed 5, which includes bug fixes for issues identified in previous versions.

| Component | Version |  Type   |                                                   Description                                                           |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BDR       | 5.0.0   | Feature | Title <p> Body </p> |
| BDR       | 5.0.0   | Feature | Enhanced routing capabilities <p> BDR cluster elects a write leader for every group (and associated location) using per group RAFT when routing is enabled for the group. It takes care of write leader failover and provides SQL commands to change a write leader. </p> |
| Proxy     | 5.0.0   | Feature | PGD built-in proxy <p>  A TCP layer 4, pass through proxy for PGD cluster using routing capabilities of BDR. The proxy is used by applications that require conflict free data. </p> |
| CLI       | 5.0.0   | Feature | Proxy management and configuration <p> `pgd` supports `create-proxy`, `delete proxy`, `set-group-options`, `set-node-options`, `set-proxy-options`, `show-proxies`, `show-groups` and `switchover` to configure and manage Proxy per group. </p> |
| CLI       | 5.0.0   | Change  | Remove `show-camo` command and remove CAMO check from `check-health` command. Support for `commit scopes` in CLI will be added in a future release. |
| CLI       | 5.0.0   | Change  | Modify output of `show-nodes` and `show-raft` commands to accomodate routing capabilities |
| CLI       | 5.0.0   | Feature | PGD cluster verification <p> CLI supports two new commands `verify-settings` and `verify-cluster`. `verify-settings` verifies the PostgreSQL configuration of each node in a PGD cluster against the recommendations. `verify-cluster` verifies the PGD cluster architectures against the flexible architecture deployment recommendations.</p> |
| BDR       | 5.0.0   | Feature | Support non-default replication sets with Decoding Worker <p> Allows Decoding Worker feature to be used in clusters using non-default replication sets like assymetric replication setup. </p> |
| BDR       | 5.0.0   | Change  | Separate Task Management from Autopartition <p> In this release, the autopartition work queue mechanism has been moved to a separate module called Task Manager (taskmgr). The task manager is responsible for creating new tasks and executing the ones created by the local node or the task manager leader node. The autopartition worker is thus renamed as taskmgr worker process in this release.  </p> <p> In the older PGD releases, the Raft leader was responsible for creating new work items. But that creates a problem because a witness node can become a Raft leader while it does not have the full view of the cluster objects. In this release, we have introduced a concept of Task Manager Leader node. The node is selected automatically by PGD, but for upgraded clusters, its important to set the `node_kind` properly for all nodes in the cluster. The user is expected to this manually  after upgrading to the latest PGD version by calling bdr.alter_node_kind() SQL function for each node. </p> |
| BDR       | 5.0.0   | Change  | Add a new SQL `bdr.alter_node_kind()` function <p> This is used to set the `node_kind` for nodes that are upgraded from the old PGD versions. Accepted values are data, witness, subscriber-only and standby </p> |
| BDR       | 5.0.0   | Change  | Replace bdr.internal_node_pre_commit catalog with shared memory based implementation <p> In the older PGD versions, CAMO and Eager were using bdr.internal_node_pre_commit catalog to track the status of recently finished transactions. Because this was a physical table, writes to it were slow. Instead, we now use a shared memory based hash table to track the status of the transactions. This should improve performance of CAMO and Eager transactions. </p> |
| BDR       | 5.0.0   | Feature | Add a new benchmarking utility `pgd_bench` <p> The utility supports benchmarking CAMO transactions and in future releases will be used for benchmarking PGD specific workloads.  </p> |
| BDR       | 5.0.0   | Feature | Add support for HASH partitioning in Autopartition <p> Extend autopartition/autoscale to support HASH partitioning. Many of  things that are required for RANGE partitioning are not needed for HASH partitioning. For example, we expect to create all HASH partitions in one go (at least for the current work; later we may change this). We don't expect HASH partitions to be moved to a different tablespace or dropped. So data retention policies don't apply for HASH partitioning. </p> |
