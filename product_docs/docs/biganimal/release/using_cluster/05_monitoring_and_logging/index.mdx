With BigAnimal you have a few options for monitoring and logging solutions:

- You can view metrics and logs from your cloud provider. For more information about viewing metrics and logs from your cloud provider, see:

  - [Viewing metrics and logs from Azure](monitoring_from_azure)

  - [Viewing metrics and logs from AWS](monitoring_from_aws)

  For details on the types and format of metrics available from BigAnimal in your cloud provider see [Metrics details](metrics).

- BigAnimal provides a Prometheus-compatible endpoint you can use to connect to your own metrics infrastructure such as your AWS Managed Grafana, as well as the option to view logs from your cloud provider's blob storage solution. For more information, see [Other Monitoring and logging solutions](other_monitoring). 

- For existing Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) users who want to monitor BigAnimal clusters alongside self-managed Postgres clusters, you can use the remote monitoring capability of PEM. For more information on using PEM to monitor your clusters, see [Remote monitoring](/pem/latest/pem_admin/02a_pem_remote_monitoring).
