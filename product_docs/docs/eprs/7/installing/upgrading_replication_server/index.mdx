You can install Replication Server 7 when you have existing single-master or multi-master replication systems that are running under Replication Server version 7.

It is assumed that you are installing Replication Server 7.x on the same host machine that is currently running the earlier version of Replication Server you are upgrading from and that you will then manage the existing replication systems using Replication Server 7.x.

If you are using a version of Replication Server earlier than 6.2.x on Linux, first upgrade to 6.2.x, and then upgrade to version 7.x. See:
- [Upgrading to xDB Replication Server 6.2](/eprs/6.2/10_appendix/02_upgrading_to_xdb6_2)
- [Upgrading from a Replication Server 6.2 installation on Linux](upgrading_with_xdb_rpm_package)
