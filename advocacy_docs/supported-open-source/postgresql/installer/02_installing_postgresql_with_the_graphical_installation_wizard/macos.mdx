EDB provides MacOS installers for PostgreSQL on the [EDB downloads page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads). These installers simplify setting up a system.

For a detailed walk-through of the installation process on Mac OS, see [this tutorial](https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgres-tutorials/installation-postgresql-mac-os).

## Command-line tools

After installing PostgreSQL, you can run command-line tools by referencing them in the `bin` directory under the installation path you specified during installation. For example, to run `psql` from the default installation directory, enter:

```shell
/Library/PostgreSQL/12/bin/psql -U postgres
```

For ease of use, you can add this directory to your `PATH` by adding a line to your `~/.bash_profile`. If using zsh, add it instead to `~/.zshrc`.

```shell
export PATH="/Library/PostgreSQL/12/bin/:$PATH"
```

This step is especially important if you plan to use scripts or other software that rely on PostgreSQL tools, such as Python's `psycopg2`. You can instead [add this directory](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106355/setting-the-system-wide-path-environment-variable-in-mavericks/106814#106814) to the system path.

Several other options for installing PostgreSQL on MacOS offer varying levels of flexibility, version support, add-ons, and so on. You find more details on [the PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/).
