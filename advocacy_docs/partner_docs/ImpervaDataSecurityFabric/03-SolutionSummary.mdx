Imperva Data Security Fabric (DSF), previously known as Imperva SecureSphere, protects data with a hybrid security solution that is usable by all data types. Imperva Data Security Fabric can help organizations reduce security risks from inside and outside sources, whether it be unintended or malicious.

The Imperva Data Security Fabric Agent is an integral part of the Imperva Data Security Fabric solution, and requires minimal resources.  This allows the database server to continue to function normally while providing constant, real-time monitoring of databases and database traffic.

The diagram below shows how you can integrate the Imperva Data Security Fabric Agent with your EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL deployments. The Imperva Data Security Fabric agent resides on your databases allowing it to monitor and continuously analyze all data access activity on both database user and privileged user accounts, in order to check for compliance or violations of security policy.
